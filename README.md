## `Project Overview` 
- Developed a Machine Learning model for real-time fire and smoke detection.
- Achieved high accuracy in fire detection to minimize false alarms.
- Designed and implemented an alarm system to promptly alert occupants and authorities.
- Created a mechanism to automatically activate fire extinguishers upon fire detection.
- Developed a web/mobile app for remote monitoring and timely alerts.
- Logged and analyzed fire incident data for insights and improvements.
- Ensured the system's stability, performed regular maintenance, and validated its functionality.

## `Components`
- **Camera** - to capture and monitor the environment. 📷
- **Raspberry Pi** - a microcontroller that acts as a CPU. 🥧
- **Relay** - to act as a switch to activate/deactivate the pump. 🔌
- **DC water pump** - to pump out water to extinguish the fire. 🚰
- **Power module** - a voltage converter to give stable power. 🔋
- **Monitor** - to display the detected images. 💻
- **Mouse and Keyboard** - to perform necessary actions. 🖱️
