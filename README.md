# AutomaticFireExtinguisher-IOT


-Developed a Machine Learning model for real-time fire and smoke detection
-Achieved high accuracy in fire detection to minimize false alarms
-Designed and implemented an alarm system to promptly alert occupants and authorities
-Created a mechanism to automatically activate fire extinguishers upon fire detection
-Developed a web/mobile app for remote monitoring and timely alerts
-Logged and analyzed fire incident data for insights and improvements
-Ensured the system's stability, performed regular maintenance, and validated its functionality



Components of Automatic Fire Extinguisher

Camera               -  to capture and monitor the environment 
Raspberry Pi         -  a microcontroller acts as a CPU
Relay                -  to act as a switch to activate/deactivate the pump
DC water pump        -  to pump out water to extinguish the fire
Power module         -  a voltage converter to give stable power
Monitor              -  to display the detected images 
Mouse and Keyboard   -  to perform necessary actions
